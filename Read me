This is a ai companion that will sit anywhere that you can ask questions. It's like a chat gpt on your desk but the ai will personalize. I made this project beacause it could be really 
helpful for projects that I am making (beacuse I can ask it things) and I also want to use this as a useful project to help me get into college. It also might pose as a thing you can talk to.
The details for the ai are,
Advanced Learning Strategies
1. Contextual Bandit - Original reinforcement learning
2. Evolutionary Optimization - Genetic algorithms that evolve better behavior parameters
3. Meta-Learning - Learns how to learn more effectively over time
Self-Modification Features
- Auto-Strategy Switching : AI automatically switches between learning strategies based on performance
- Evolutionary Population : Maintains 20 evolving behavior variants, selects the best performers
- Meta-Parameter Adaptation : Continuously adjusts learning parameters based on performance trends
- Performance Validation : Tracks metrics and validates improvements before keeping changes
Performance Tracking
- Real-time Metrics : Positive feedback rate, response time, learning efficiency
- Performance Score : Composite score (0-1) for overall AI effectiveness
- Strategy Comparison : Automatically tests different approaches and selects the best
Self improvement
1. Multi-Strategy Learning : Tries different approaches simultaneously
2. Performance Monitoring : Tracks which strategies work best for each user
3. Auto-Adaptation : Switches to better performing strategies automatically
4. Evolution : Evolves behavior parameters using genetic algorithms
5. Meta-Learning : Learns optimal learning rates and exploration patterns
